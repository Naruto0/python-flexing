# Snakes

## _"I tell ya what I'm gonna give you, Snakes!"_

Who won't remember the greatest movie of all time
[Angels with Filthy Souls](https://www.https://homealone.fandom.com/wiki/Angels_with_Filthy_Souls "Home Alone Wiki").
What a shame this title has no score on IMDB, tought there is maybe nothing
but _third party-Director's_ cut.

So everytime there are _Snakes_, i almost immediately think of this film.
Which, well... does not really exist.

Let's look the ultimate truth in the eye.

### There also does not exist simple snake implementation in python

I challenge you to do `better` with less _code_.

Once you are done, raise an issue and i will add you to list.

Rules:

- use whichever `python` module you want _(might be SDL wrapper, as i used `pygame`)_
- do not overcomplicate the code
- you may or may not incorporate `collision` and `gameover`
- make it _ground up_, do not copy anyone

#### Note

You may use my code as an inspiration to whichever project. This was made one
evening as self-challenge.
